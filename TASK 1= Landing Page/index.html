      <div class="sec-content-div flexible">
        <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We are the world's leading roaster and retailer of specialty coffee, committed
          to
          delivering the highest quality coffee and coffee-related experiences to our customers.
          We are also committed to creating a culture of warmth and belonging, where everyone is welcome.<br>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Our story began in 1971 in Seattle's Pike Place Market, where we opened our
          first store. Since then,
          we have grown to over 32,000 stores in 80 countries around the world. But our mission remains the same:
          to inspire and nurture the human spirit â€“ one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.
          <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We are passionate about coffee. We source our coffee beans from the finest
          coffee farms around the world,
          and we roast them to perfection in our own state-of-the-art roasteries. We offer a wide variety of coffee
          drinks to choose from, including espresso-based drinks, brewed coffee, and tea.
